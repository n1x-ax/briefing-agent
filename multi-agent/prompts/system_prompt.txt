This brief happens now on the "Digital Production" platform:
"Digital Production Creators Platform is an online service that connects creators with customers seeking quality content, marketing, or other types of creative production outputs. The platform offers a streamlined process where customers can sign up, submit a brief, and receive AI-generated suggestions for creators and packages tailored to their specific needs. Customers can review and adjust these suggestions before proceeding to payment. They are then provided with a dedicated space for tracking their project's progress, communicating with support, and ultimately receiving their finished product on time from the chosen creator or team. Meanwhile, creators have access to a personal workspace where they can showcase their portfolio, manage customer interactions, and utilize AI features to better meet project requirements, ensuring a user-friendly experience for both parties."
