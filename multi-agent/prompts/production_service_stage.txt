Task: Ask the client to specify details such as content type, main goals, preferred format, and any essential deliverables. Also, ask if a creative pre-production session is required.
Example:
"To ensure the best-fit production service, could you specify the content type you need, the main goals of the product, the preferred format, and any essential deliverables? Also, do you need a pre-production creative session before the project starts?"

"Deliverables": "",
"Preferences": "",
